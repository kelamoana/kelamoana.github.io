												<h2>Jotes!</h2>
												<p>Python</p>
											</header>
											<p>Collaborated with a team of 5 developers and led the backend design for Jotes! which took a .wav audio file, 
												transcribed any spoken audio to text, analyzed the transcribed audio to identify keywords, 
													and uploaded definitions to those keywords.
											</p>
											<br>
											<strong>My Biggest Obstacle:</strong> <p>Troubleshooting errors with the API that did not have a clear fix. For example,
											 I was in charge of figuring out how to properly set up environmental variables to allow our API key to be used correctly. I also found solutions to the API's incompatibility issues with 
											specific audio files (.mp4 and .mp3) by analyzing the GitHub code and determining that the .wav file was the only compatible type.</p>

												<h2>FLUCI</h2>
												<p>JavaScript</p>
											</header>
											<p>Led the backend design of this web application for a team of 4 developers. 
												FLUCI allowed users to report coughs and reflect coughing hotspots on a live map of UC Irvine using Google Maps API.</p>
											<br>
											<strong>Learning a New Language:</strong><p>Single-handedly developed the backend of the project by learning how to use Node.js and intertwining two different APIs. This was a major 
												accomplishment for me because I was not familiar with JavaScript at all, and I had less than 24 hours to learn a handful of syntactic/modularic subtleties and then apply them to two different APIs that I had never used before. 
												Building this application up to a point where it was both usable and robust was a major milestone for me given the time I had and the resources at my disposal.

												<h2>PetrChat Server</h2>
												<p>C</p>
											</header>
											<p>Designed a multi-threaded server that could concurrently host hundreds of users that had the capability to create/delete chat rooms, send direct messages, and customize a username.</p>
											<br>
											<strong>A New Approach to Coding:</strong><p>Due to the density of this project, it was apparent that it would be easy to get lost with concurrency bugs. With that in mind, my partner and I decided to design 
												the entire project from head to toe, before we typed any code. We discussed tradeoffs of each potential design decision on micro and macro levels. This led to our success with the project - only running into 2 quick-fix concurrency bugs and finishing with 
												a robust and efficient application capable of holding a large number of users.

											<h2>Custom Linux Shell</h2>
											<p>C</p>
										</header>
										<p>Developed a shell that allowed a user to change directories, read/write to files, and pipe commands.</p>
										<br>
										<strong>What I learned:</strong><p>By creating this shell I learned the intricacies of process forking and the different challenges that comes with implementing it
											in a program, especially one with the capability of piping/directing input and output. Keeping track of PIDs, properly reaping zombie children, managing memory, and understanding the scheduling process were the most difficult aspects of 
											creating the logic for the program. By whiteboarding my code design and learning to create small python scripts capable of giving input to the shell
											and writing to stderror, I was able to incrementally develop and test the program.

											<h2>Minesweeper</h2>
											<p>MIPS Assembly</p>
										</header>
										<p>Implemented the model portion of Minesweeper to compliment a UI that displayed colored tiles to the player.</p>
										<br>
										<strong>Achievement Unlocked:</strong><p>This was the first fully-playable game I have developed and using MIPS was a difficult
											but rewarding experience. Due to using MIPS, I had to focus the backend aspects of the project, especially memory management - ensuring I stored the 
											state of the game correctly by properly manipulating bits, managing registers and memory blocks. From this experience, I grew to have a greater appreciation/understanding of higher level languages.</p>

											<h2>League Smart Overlay</h2>
											<p>Python</p>
										</header>
										<p>Built a dynamic League of Legends stream Overlay capable of automatically updating based on in-game events.</p>
									<br>
									<strong>Something a Little Different:</strong> <p>This project was the first time I took a crack at creating something for the Esports industry. My team and I have been
										Shoutcasting for years, and have come across the same problems - production overlays were too difficult for 1 person to manage. So why not automate that process? We successfully
										integrated python scripts to create a smart and dynamic overlay for League of Legends, capabale of allowing a true 1 person team to observe and produce a full stream from beginning to end. I was
										tasked with implementing the twitter stream and dynamic imaging for this project.

										<h2>ScrimsBot</h2>

									<p>Created a Discord Bot using the Discord.js API that simulated school-yard drafts for a server that hosts gaming scrimmages.</p>
								<br>
								<strong>Something a Little Different:</strong> <p>This project was the first time I took a crack at coding a bot. One of the biggest difficulties I had with this project was learning to use the Discord.js 
									API, mostly because the documentation did not align with the current functionality of the API. Many of the previous available functions were not available anymore and having to look at different 
									github repositories was my main mode of learning outside of a few websites/tutorials.</p>
